"My hometown, Bangarupalyam, is situated in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. It's a beautiful part of the state, and I have fond memories of exploring the surrounding areas."

While it might not be a big city, it has a unique charm.

we are good in having best educational institutions.

we dont need to worry about the medical facilities around us.

we are also very near to a Tirumala temple of lord sri venkateswara swamy well known tourist places and most visited religious sites globally.

while coming to agriculture we have a huge production of mangoes, sugarcane, paddy, milk, tomatoes.

Chittoor is known as a major market center for mangoes. and in my village we have a biggest mango market in near chittoor and surroundings.

Growing up in Chittoor, I always felt like I was at the heart of a cultural melting pot. The district's location, where Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka meet, has resulted in a fascinating blend of influences

This blend even shows in festivals. We celebrate Sankranti from Andhra, Pongal from Tamil Nadu, and Ugadi from Karnataka, all within a short span. It's a vibrant and diverse place to grow up.

Being from a smaller town like Bangarupalyam in Chittoor district, I learned the value of hard work and resourcefulness from a young age. These qualities have helped me be adaptable and efficient in my work
